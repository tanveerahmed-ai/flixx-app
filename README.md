📖 What I Learned

Through building this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript

Using fetch API to get and display data dynamically

Creating and styling responsive layouts with CSS

Structuring a project with multiple pages (Home, About, Movie, TV Show)

Working with Git & GitHub for version control and project showcase

🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of a learning exercise to practice building a front-end application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is intended for portfolio and interview showcase purposes.
